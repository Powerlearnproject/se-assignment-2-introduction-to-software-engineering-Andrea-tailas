# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
<!-- Define Software Engineering: -->

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
->Software engineering is the process of designing,developing,testing, and maintaining software. It differs from traditioal programming in the following ways:
1. Software engineering emphasizes on use of systematic and disciplined approaches to software development eg Agile while traditional programming deals with ad-hoc coding practices.
2. software engineering strongly emphasizes on quality assurance by using methods such as testing and debugging while traditional programming does not put much emphasis on quality assurance.
3. The scope of software engineering covers the entire software development process from planning to maintenance while traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve specific problems.

<!-- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): -->

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
-> This is a structured process involving a number of steps:
1. Planning and requirement Analysis- This is the first step in the development life cycle. It entails planning for the development process and also collecting information that will be used in the development process eg costing
2. Requirements definition. In this process a software specifications requirement (SRC) document is prepared containing all the requirements for the target software.
3. Designing-Using the SRS the designers come up with the best architecture for the software by developing multiple designs for the product.
4. Development- This is where the development of the product starts using designs developed in earlier stage. It involves coding.
5. Product testing and integration- this process involves testing the product to make sure it meets all the requirements and it is functioning as expected.
6. Deployment- upon successful completion of the product it is deployed for use in this stage. Maintenance practices like updates are later carried out on the product to improve efficiency.

<!-- Agile vs. Waterfall Models: -->

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
1. Waerfall model has a fixed deadline while agile model adopts the project process.
2. waterfall model does not involve clients in the development process while agile does.
3. waterfall model is incremental and each phase must be complete before moving on to the next while agile is flexible throught the development process and changing requirements can be incorporated even at later stages.
4. waterfall model has a fixed budget while agile model has a flexible budget.
-> waterfall model is used where all requirements are known at the beginning of the development process and there can be no changing requirements while agile can be used where requirements can change from time to time and client involvement is needed.

<!-- Requirements Engineering: -->

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
->software requirements engineering is the process of indentifying, eliciting,analyzing,specifying,validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.The process has five stages:
1. feasibility study-Three types of feasibility studies are carried out ie technicel,operational and economic feasibility to analyze the outcome of the project on whether it will be beneficial or profitable or not.
2. requirements elicitation-  here various ways are used to gain knowledge on the project domain and requirements including interviews with customers, brainstorming among others.
3. requirements specification- here all functional and non-functional requirements and the constraints are specified and modelled. Models such as ER diagrams are used.
4. Requirements verification and validation. various tasks are carried out to ensure that the software correctly implements a specific function and that the software that has been build is traceable to customer requirements.
5. Requirements management- here requirements are analyzed,documented and tracked. It involves managing the requirements to cater for changing requirements in the development process.

<!-- Software Design Principles: -->

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
->Modularity involves breaking the software into smaller,reusable components that can be developed and tested indepedently.It improves maintainability and scalability in that smaller components are easy to maintain and develop.

<!-- Testing in Software Engineering: -->

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-> Testing involves verifyng and validating that a software application is free of bugs,meets the technical requirements and satisfies requirements efficiently and effectively.
1. unit testing- individual components/units of a system are tested to validate that each unit performs as designed.
2. integration testing- individual units are combined and tested as a group to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.
3. system testing- This level involves testing a complete system as a whole to evaluate the system's compliance with the specified requirements.
4. acceptance testing- A system is tested for acceptability ie compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

<!-- Version Control Systems: -->

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
-> A version control system is a category of software tols that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping track of modifications done in the code.
-> Version control systems are important in helping the developer team to effeciently communicate and manage all the changes that have been made to the source code and who made those changes.
-> Popular version controls include Git,Helix core and Microsoft TFS

<!-- Software Project Management: -->

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
-> A software product manager is the person who oversees the software development process. His/her responsibilites include:
1. Project estmation- estimates cost,duration and effort required.
2. Scheduling- Sheduling of manpower and resources.
3. Staffing- Team stracture and staffing.
4. Risk management- Identifying the unanticipated risks that may occur during the project, analyze the damage that might cause these risks and take a risk education plan to cope with these risks.

<!-- Software Maintenance: -->

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
->software maintenance is the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer.
->software maintenance is essential in keeping the system working correctly,efficiently and securely and to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the users.
->Maintenance activities include:
1. Bug fixing
2. Enhancements such as adding new features
3. Performance optimization eg improving the speed
4. Porting and migration eg adapting software to run on new hardware
5. Re-engineering eg improving software architecture
6. documentation

<!-- Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: -->

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
->Ethical issues that software engineers might face include:
1. Algorithmic bias
2. Unethical data collection from system users
3. Weak security
4. wrong priorities eg focusing on creating new features rather than improving existig functions.
-> For software engineers to adhere to ethics they can follow the following steps:
1. Be proactive- Think ahead in terms of potential threats and misconducts
2. Be honest- Be truthful when describing your goods and dont exagerate on performance
3. Be accountable- avoid sharing misleading information to clients or stakeholders.
